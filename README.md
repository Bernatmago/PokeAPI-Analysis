# PokeAPI
Simple project consiting on gathering data, dumping it into a database and extracting some basic knowledge to practice some data science.

In this case i have opted for the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and stored some data on a local MongoDB collection.

## How to use
1. Set up an `env` file containing the URI of your MongoDB database in a variable named `MONGO_URI`:
2. Run `python create_pokemon_database.py`
3. Launch `pokemon_notebook.ipynb`
4. Enjoy!

**Note:** There is currently an issue with embedded image visualization on the notebook, looking for an elegant fix
