# BDA-Project
This project consisted on gathering data dumping it into a database and extracting some basic knowledge.

In my case i opted for using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) and storing some simple documents on a local MongoDB database.

## How to run
1. Set up an `env` file containing the URI of your MongoDB database in a variable named `MONGO_URI`:
2. Run `python create_pokemon_database.py`
3. Launch `pokemon_notebook.ipynb`
4. Enjoy!

**Note:** There is currently an issue with embedded image visualization on the notebook, looking for an elegant fix
